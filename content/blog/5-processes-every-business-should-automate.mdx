Every organization has them. Those tedious, repetitive processes that eat hours out of every week. Someone copies data from an email into a spreadsheet. Someone else chases down approvals through a chain of forwarded messages. A report gets manually compiled every Friday afternoon.

These aren't just annoyances. They're **costing you real money**.

The average knowledge worker spends 4.5 hours per week on tasks that could be automated. For a team of 20, that's 4,680 hours per year, wasted on work a machine could do in seconds.

Here are five processes you should automate today.

## 1. Approval Workflows

**The problem:** Someone submits a request. It gets emailed to a manager. The manager forgets. Someone follows up. Three days later, it finally gets approved.

**The fix:** Power Automate can route approvals automatically. The request hits the right person's inbox (or Teams or mobile app), they tap approve or reject, and the workflow continues. Escalation rules handle the "I forgot" scenario automatically.

**Time saved:** 2-5 hours per week per department.

## 2. Data Entry Between Systems

**The problem:** Information lives in one system but needs to be in another. Someone copies and pastes. Errors creep in. Nobody trusts the data.

**The fix:** Power Automate connectors link your systems directly. When data changes in System A, it automatically updates in System B. No human in the loop means no human error.

**Time saved:** 3-8 hours per week depending on volume.

## 3. Report Generation and Distribution

**The problem:** Every week (or month), someone pulls data from multiple sources, builds a report in Excel or PowerPoint, and emails it to stakeholders.

**The fix:** Power BI handles the visualization. Power Automate handles the scheduling and distribution. Reports generate themselves and land in the right inboxes at the right time.

**Time saved:** 4-10 hours per reporting cycle.

## 4. Employee Onboarding Tasks

**The problem:** New hire starts Monday. IT needs to set up accounts. HR needs to send documents. The manager needs to schedule orientation. Half of it gets forgotten.

**The fix:** A single Power Automate flow triggers the entire sequence. New employee record created? Accounts get provisioned, welcome emails go out, tasks get assigned to the right people, and nothing falls through the cracks.

**Time saved:** 5-10 hours per new hire.

## 5. Invoice Processing

**The problem:** Invoices arrive by email. Someone downloads them, enters the data into the accounting system, routes them for approval, and follows up on payment.

**The fix:** AI Builder in Power Automate can extract data from invoices automatically. The data flows into your accounting system, approval workflows route to the right people, and payment schedules are tracked without manual intervention.

**Time saved:** 3-6 hours per week.

## The ROI Is Hard to Ignore

Let's do quick math. If you automate just these five processes for a mid-size team:

- **Conservative estimate:** 15-35 hours saved per week
- **Annual savings:** 780-1,820 hours
- **At $50/hour loaded cost:** $39,000-$91,000 per year

That's before you factor in reduced errors, faster turnaround times, and happier employees who get to do actual meaningful work instead of copying data between spreadsheets.

## Getting Started

You don't have to automate everything at once. Pick the process that causes the most pain, build a solution, measure the results, and expand from there.

That's exactly how we work at Northern Analytics. We start with discovery, identify the highest-impact opportunities, and deliver working solutions in weeks, not months.
