    description: 'I build Power Automate flows that replace the repetitive stuff your team does every day. Think daily production reports that compile themselves, approval chains that actually move, and data that flows between systems without anyone touching it. One logistics team I worked with was burning 2,000 hours a month on manual data entry. I automated the worst of it and gave them that time back.',
